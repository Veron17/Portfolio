          <p>It is with nervous tingling fingers as I write this post, journal or whatever you want to call it. I do not
            want to have
            the burdersome feeling of making the next world of text feel like a <i>"Resolution" &nbsp;</i> for this
            year,
            2020</p>
          <p>
            Instead, making it serve as a reminder or reshifting my focus on the path that I would and want to take.

            If I would to sum up last year, 2019 in one word, it would be <i>"Lost". &nbsp;</i>

            <p> And I would like to exactly change just that.</p>
            <p><b>Embark on a path of finding myself once again</b> </p>

            I spent most of my life last year in my head, wishing to accomplish things that I always wanted to do but
            was constantly held back by overthinking and
            the fear of wasting time, which personally to me, equates to failure. Always trying to find the right
            formulae of doing things and
            trying to structure things in a order, be it learning a new skill or improving my understanding of a
            programming language.
            Not saying that you should not have a structure, but just have a basic one and get going at it.
          </p>

          <p> And I would like to exactly change just that.</p>
          <p><b>Think Less, Do More</b>.</p>

          I was always wary of what others would think of me, be it the way I act or the things I say.
          <p>Whenever a certain idea or thought sprungs up in my head, I would habitually
            think about the inital reaction or outcome I would receive from the opposite party, decide whether there
            will be a high likelihood of it being positive,
            before allowing it to leave. I wasn't being myself, I was just an avatar of what I think people would like
            to see in me.
            The constant fear of being judged and the arduous repetitive thought process was not only mentally tiring,
            but also prevented me from opening up and gaining new knowledge that comes along with the friendships. I
            would just like to
            be myself.
          </p>
          <p> And I would like to exactly change just that.</p>

          <p><b>Be more spontaneous, Open up</b>.</p>
          <p>
            I wanted to make more friends. I really wanted. I wanted to know more about the stories of other people.
            But I was stuck. An invisible lock at my mouth. In the midst of finding the correct key, the opportunity
            disappeared.
            I wanted to join more activities. I really wanted. I wanted my life to be more fufilling and eventful.
            But I was stuck. Invisble chains tangled my limbs. In the midst of untangling, the opportunity disappeared
            again.
            I want you to know that it is okay to be alone, alone in the room. Be impromptu and get yourself involved
            and learn more with less thoughts.
            You never know what you might get out from the room, be it a new friendship or newfound knowledge.

          </p>
          </p>
          <p> And I would like to exactly change just that.</p>

          <p>
            A 180 degree turn in personality? Definitely not.
            I just want to keep going and growing, knowing that I am a better version of myself everyday,
            and even if I am not, just carry on.
            At the end of the day, I just want to smile and tell myself to keep a move on.
